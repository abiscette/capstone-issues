This repository contains the public issue tracker for the capstone project. The information you need to write effective bug reports.

What should be in a big report?
-------------------------------
### Title
The title of the issue should be precise. 

+ Instead of writing "Login is broken.", write "Login is returning error 400.".
+ Instead of writing "Problems with the main menu", write "Main menu is overlapping content.".

Keeping issue titles very targeted allows us to find and fix the issue and not confuse it with other possibly unrelated issues that fall under the same generic description.

### Steps to reporoduce
Provide the minimum steps required to make the issue happen should be listed. Having detailed steps lets us figure out exactly what factors may have been involved in the error. The steps should be enumerated using a list using complete imperative sentances.

1. Log in using valid credentials.
2. Click the Admin menu item in the main navigation menu. 
3. Refresh the browser.

### Expected Result
You should write exactly what you expected to happen when you encountered the issue. The more detail you can include about yoru expectations, the better we will be able to fix the problem.

### Actual Result
Describe exactly what the result was when you encountered the issue. This should also be as detailed as possible. Include any logs or errors you encountered.

### Environment
Include the following information with very issue:
+ Device manufacturer and model
+ OS version
+ Browser and version

For example:
Desktop PC, Ubuntu 14.10, Chrome 43.0.2327.5 dev (64-bit)

### Images
If it is easier to include a screen shot than describe the problem in words, that is perfectly fine. Keep the file to a resonable size and attach it to the issue.
